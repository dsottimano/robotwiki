<h3>What is Hubot?</h3>

<p>Hubot is your company's robot. Install him in your company to dramatically improve and reduce employee efficiency.</p>

<h3>No seriously, what is Hubot?</h3>

<p>GitHub, Inc., wrote the first version of Hubot to automate our company chat room. Hubot knew how to deploy the site, automate a lot of tasks, and be a source of fun in the company. Eventually he grew to become a formidable force in GitHub. But he led a private, messy life. So we rewrote him.</p>

<p>Today's version of Hubot is open source, written in CoffeeScript on Node.js, and easily deployed on platforms like Heroku. More importantly, Hubot is a standardized way to share scripts between everyone's robots.</p>

<h3>What can Hubot do?</h3>

<p>We ship Hubot with a small group of core scripts: things like posting images, translating languages, and integrating with Google Maps.We also maintain a repository of community Hubot scripts and an organization of community Hubot packages that you can add to your own robot.</p>

<p>The real fun happens when you add your own scripts. Be sure to personalize your Hubot, too; your company's robot should be a place full of inside jokes, custom integrations, and general merriment.</p>

<h3>How do I write my own Hubot scripts?</h3>

<p>Check out this documentation for writing your own Hubot scripts. Then the sky's the limit; just add them to your generated `scripts` directory.</p>

<p>If you write a Hubot script for taking over the world, please let us know.</p>
